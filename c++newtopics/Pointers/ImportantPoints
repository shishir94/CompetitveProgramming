Precedence check karni h::
1. "++" operator takes precedence over the " * " operator, and the "()" operators take precedence over everything 
           else.

2. the ++number operator is the same as the number++ operator if you're not assigning them to anything. The difference 
 is number++ returns number and then increments number, and ++number increments first and then returns it.

3. By increasing the value of a pointer, you're incrementing it by the sizeof its contents, that is you're incrementing 
it as if you were iterating in an array.

ptr++;    --> Pointer moves to the next int position (as if it was an array)
++ptr;    --> Pointer moves to the next int position (as if it was an array)
++*ptr;   --> The value pointed at by ptr is incremented
++(*ptr); --> The value pointed at by ptr is incremented
++*(ptr); -->The value pointed at by ptr is incremented
*ptr++;   --> Pointer moves to the next int position (as if it was an array). But returns the old content
(*ptr)++; --> The value pointed at by ptr is incremented
*(ptr)++; --> Pointer moves to the next int position (as if it was an array). But returns the old content
*++ptr;   --> Pointer moves to the next int position, and then get's accessed, with your code, segfault
*(++ptr); --> Pointer moves to the next int position, and then get's accessed, with your code, segfault
