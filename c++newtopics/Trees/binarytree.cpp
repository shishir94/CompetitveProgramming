// BINARY TREE :
/*
In which the degree of each node is less than or equal to two. We can say that the each node has less than or equal to 2 
children.
DEGREE : Number of nodes connected to each node.

Example ::  7 is connected to 3 and 4 and 3 is coonected to 5. In this degree of 7 is 2 and degree of 3 and 4 is 1 and 0 
        respectively. This is an example of binary tree.

Some imporatnat points regarding trees:
1). Trees are made up of nodes and edges.
2). If there are n nodes then there are n-1 edges. As there is no edge on root of the tree.
3). Degree : Number of direct children ( for a node).
4). Degree of the tree is the hightest of all the degree of the nodes.
5). Binary tree --> tree of degree 2 or  nodes can have 0 ,1 ,2 children.
*/

// Types of binary trees:: 
/*
1). FULL OR STRICT BINARY TREE :: All nodes have either 0 0r 2 children.
Example :: There is a root having two children and both these have either 0 or 2 children.

2).PERFECT BINARY TREE :: Internal nodes have 2 children and all leaf nodes are on same level.

3).COMPLETE BINARY TREE :: All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and last level must have its keys
               as left as possible.

        Examples :: 1) There is a root having two children and they also have 2 children each.
                    2) There is a root having two children and these children have 2 and 1 children respectively.

4). DEGENERATE TREE :: Every Parent node is having exactly one child.
                Example :: 1) There is a root having one child and that child is also having one child.

5). SKEWED TREE :: Left skewed(in which all the nodes are on the left hand side) and right skewed(in which all the nodes are
                   on the right handd sides).
